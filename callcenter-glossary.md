### Call center vs Contact center

A call center uses either the public switched telephone network or VoIP for calls. A call center communicates only by voice.

A contact center still uses voice communication, most likely VoIP. In addition to phone calls, contact centers use email, text chat, and web interfaces to communicate with clients or customers.

Call centers can have divided labor between inbound and outbound agents or **blended agents** that handle both types of calling. Contact centers feature agents that can handle **all** its forms of communication.

Your customer service representatives are so much more than support agents — they’re your brand ambassadors. Whether it’s over the phone, in person, on the web, through email, or on social media, your customers expect a service experience that is smarter, more personalized, and requires minimal e ort. Their satisfaction — and whether they take their business to your competitor — depends on it.
