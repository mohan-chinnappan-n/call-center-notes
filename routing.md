Skills-Based Routing: skills-based routing routes the calls to the agent with the most applicable skill set, which improves efficiency and customer experience.

**Other Routings:**


Location-Based Routing:

 location-based routing routes incoming calls based on the customer’s location. Location-based routing can utilize caller id, GPS positioning, and signal triangulation to determine the location of the customer, or service provider, which is then accordingly routed. Location-based routing allows for varying degrees of complexity to be implemented with this type of routing, which makes it a flexible routing choice.

Service-Level Routing & Dynamic-Based Routing: 

service-level routing is a type of dynamic-based routing. Dynamic-based routing uses skills-based routing but also implements expected and predicted wait times into its platform to increase customer satisfaction and service level thresholds. Service-level routing, implemented with dynamic-based routing, utilizes reserve agents when queue times reach sub-optimal levels to preserve the service level.

Value Based Routing: 

value-based routing goes beyond cost and quality and focuses on a value or revenue-based routing. For example, a customer calling into a call center shortly before their contract is up is recognized as someone who might not continue their subscription to the company’s services. The call would then be routed to a retention team to ensure that the customer stays with the company.

Data-Directed Routing:

 data-directed routing uses a customer’s information to route the call to an agent that can best assist that customer. This data can be utilized in a number of ways. For example, a calling customer might be unaware of a different problem with his or her account; by routing the call to an agent that can assist that customer with their call and the additional issue, the call center is able to provide a better customer service experience for the caller.

Outbound Routing:

 outbound routing focuses on a different set of metrics. Instead of utilizing traditional metrics such as average call length or average handling time, outbound routing uses metrics like Net Promoter Score to track how many of its customers recommend the company’s services to others. Outbound routing focuses on increasing customer recommendations through techniques such as text updates and outbound calls to inform customers of their account statuses.
